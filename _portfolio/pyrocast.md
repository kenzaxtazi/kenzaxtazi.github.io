Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds are storm clouds generated by extreme wildfires. PyroCbs are associated with unpredictable, and therefore dangerous, wildfire spread. They can also inject smoke particles and trace gases into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, affecting the Earth's climate. As global temperatures increase, these previously rare events are becoming more common. Being able to predict which fires are likely to generate pyroCb is therefore key to climate adaptation in wildfire-prone areas. Pyrocast is a pipeline for pyroCb analysis and forecasting and understanding the causal drivers pyroCb events. This pipeline aims to help scientists research pyroCb and to help policymakers and local authorities efficiently allocate resources and evacuate residents and emergency responders.
