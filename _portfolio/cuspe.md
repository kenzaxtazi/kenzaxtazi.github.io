Our team of postdoctoral and PhD students proposed the Cambridgeshire Decarbonisation Fund to support the achievement of Net-Zero Cambridgeshire by 2050. We identify ways in which Cambridgeshire businesses can invest locally in community infrastructure and nature-based projects that reduce carbon emissions at their source or actively sequester carbon. This investment will support earlier reductions to carbon emissions than might otherwise occur, provide added value to the places we live, and the people that live and work here, whilst also benefiting businesses as part of their wider carbon emissions, environmental, social and governance commitments.
