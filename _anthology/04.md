### The days the sea came to me

#### Jo Seong Sik | 2020 Citizen Contest

As the kimchi pot is opened\
The smell of the sea fills the air

When this time of year came\
The waves that cultivated the seashore rocks\
Now went in, out and around them\
As if the rocks were their own home

Blowing to warm up\
Her weathered hands\
My mother used to sit on a rock opening oysters

She rolled them in a mix of young cabbage leaves\
And she would laugh if you gave her a bite\
A blossoming white flower on the tip of her tongue

### 바다가 내게 오던 날

#### 조성식 | 2020 시민공모작

김장 박스를 뜯자\
바다 냄새 가득하다

이맘때가 되면\
파도가 일구어 놓은 갯바위를\
제집 드나들 듯하였다

굽어가는 손\
흐흐 녹여가면\
바위에 눌러앉아 굴 까시던 어머니

비빈 배추 속잎에 말아\
한 입 넣어 주시면 웃으시던\
혀끝에 핀 하얀 꽃
