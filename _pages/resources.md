## Inspiration

A list of resources that have helped and inspired me.

### Climate research

ðŸ“– [Predicting our climate future](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/predicting-our-climate-future-9780198812937?cc=gb&lang=en&) by David Stainforth

### Climate policy

In their own ways these books show that fixing climate change cannot be solved through scientific and technical progress alone, but how we collectively behave other and how we perceive our responsibilities towards each other.

ðŸ“– [The Ascent of the Anthropoi: A Story](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/altered-earth/ascent-of-the-anthropoi-a-story/398D287A7F41234FB61097456223823C) by Amitav Gosh

ðŸ“– [Five Times Faster](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/five-times-faster) by Simon Sharpe

ðŸ“– [Sustainable Energy without the Hot Air](https://www.withouthotair.com/) by David MacKay
