About
----

Hi! I'm a PhD student at the University of Cambridge studying the application of AI to environmental risk. I'm advised by [Richard E. Turner](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/ret26/) at the Department of Engineering, [Scott Hosking](https://scotthosking.com) and [Andrew Orr](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/anmcr/) at the British Antarctic Survey, and [Javier Gonz√°lez](https://javiergonzalezh.github.io) at Microsoft Research Cambridge. In this website, you'll find some of my recent projects and academic resources.

Research Interests
----

* Environment and climate change, I've studied clouds, precipitation and wildfires
* Machine learning, in particular the Bayesian kind
* Climate policy, including climate adaptation and decarbonisation

Other Interests
----

* Outdoors, in particular exploring mountains. In 2014, I represented Morocco at the Sochi Winter Olympics in alpine skiing
* Korean poetry, check out some of my translations [here](poems)
* Photography, many pictures with questionable artistic merit
