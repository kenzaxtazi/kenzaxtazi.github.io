About
----

Hi! I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge studying the application of AI to environmental risk. I'm advised by [Richard E. Turner](https://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/people/ret26/) at the Department of Engineering,[Scott Hosking](https://scotthosking.com) and [Andrew Orr](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/anmcr/) at the British Antarctic Survey, and [Javier Gonzalez](https://javiergonzalezh.github.io) at Microsoft Research Cambridge.

I love the outdoors, in particular exploring mountains. In 2014, I represented Morocco at the Sochi Winter Olympics in alpine skiing. In this website you'll find some of my projects and resources.
